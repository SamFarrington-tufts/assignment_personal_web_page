  <h2>Trip Section</h2>
  <p>Last summer I visited Puerto Rico for the first time with my family. On our first night we <br />
    stopped into a restaurant to grab a bite to eat and ended up starring in a commercial for <br />
    the restaurant! There was a camera crew there that day and they saw us enjoying the food. <br />
    It was so fun and such a great story! We spent a day driving into the very scenic El Yunque <br />
    National Forest located in the Luquillo Mountains where we saw waterfalls and did some hiking. <br />
    As an excursion we decided to take a catamaran adventure to snorkel and visit private beaches. <br />
    During the snorkeling adventure a shark swam right below us, which has sparked my interest in <br />
    scuba diving/free diving. From start to finish it was truly an unforgettable trip and I wish <br />
    I could do it all over again.<br /></p>
  
  <h2>Favorite Pet Names:</h2>

    <li>Penelope the Dog</li>

  <h2>Favorite Resturant:</h2>
    <p>My favorite resturant is <a href="https://www.baysideamericancafe.com/">Bayside American Cafe</a>, located in Portland, ME. Not only is it <br />
    one of my favorite places to eat, it is also the restaurant where I fell in love with my <br />
    girlfriend. After school ended in high school, her and I would drive down and spend hours <br />
    talking over cinnamon bun pancakes. As silly as it sounds, nine years later those pancakes <br />
    are still my favorite.

  <h2>Favorite Food:</h2>
    <div id="fav_food"> <img src='soup.jpeg' align='left' width ='500'> </div>
    <div id="content"> My recent obsession is trying new recipes I find on social media. Right now I am super <br />
    excited about a recipe I found- Stanley Tucci inspired Pasta Fagioli Soup. It is the <br />
    perfect recipe for a snowy winter day. It is warm, comforting and hearty, my family cannot <br />
    get enough of it. </div>
